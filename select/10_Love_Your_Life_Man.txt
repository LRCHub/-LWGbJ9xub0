Just marking time and standing still,
When you got on life well you got no will

We're all talking and losing touch,
Knowing nothing just learning too much.

Love your life

Five clean chakras on the wall.
Good soul brother reads them all.

The city people making bread
I'm just as stupid, I'll be just as dead.

Love your life
